### Hi there 👋 I'm an AI Engineer & Researcher

I bridge the gap between academic research and production systems, with a BSc in IT (Data Science). My work focuses on applying advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly in Healthcare AI, Computer Vision, and Generative AI.
